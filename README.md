# rMousier
  
An extension for the excellent rMouse package.  
*This package requires rMouse to work.*   
  
## Functions
  
- `extra_specialKey()` works just like `rMouse::specialKey` but accepts `ctrl` and `alt` as values for the `key` argument   
  
## Suggestions?   
  
Yep, this package has one function. It's all I needed. Feel free to send any suggestions my way.  
  
Dejan, if you're out there, you can just canabalize this into `rMouse`. I'd be fine with that.
